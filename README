psmon is a Perl script which can be run as a stand alone program or a
fully functional background daemon, capable of logging to syslog with
customisable email notification facilities.

The user defines a set of rules in an Apache-style plain text
configuration file. These rules describe what processes should always be
running on the system, and any limitations on concurrent instances, TTL
and maximum CPU/memory usage of processes. psmon scans the UNIX process
table and, using the set of rules defined in the configuration file, will
respawn any dead processes, and/or slay or "deal with" any aggressive or
illegal processes.

Originally written and designed for use by a UK ISP, it is designed to be
as flexible as posible, for use on a per-user, or system-wide server
basis.

For further detailed information on what psmon can do for you, how
flexible it is and a list of all its features, please read the
documentation. Please feel free to email me at nicolaw@lilacup.2x4b.com
with any questions, suggestions or bug reports you may have.
