<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>This script monitors the process table using Proc::ProcessTable, and
will respawn or kill processes based on a set of rules defined in an
Apache style configuration file.

</P>
<P>Processes will be respawned if a spawn command is defined for a process,
and no occurrences of that process are running. If the --user command line
option is specified, then the process will only be spawned if no instances
are running as the specified userid.

</P>
<P>Processes can be killed off if they have been running for too long,
use too much CPU or memory resources, or have too many concurrent
versions running. Exceptions can be made to kill rulesets using the
<I>PIDFile</I> and <I>LastSafePID</I> directives.

</P>
<P>If a PID file is declared for a process, psmon will never kill the
process ID that is contained within the pid file. This is useful if for
example, you have a script which spawns hundreds of child processes
which you may need to automatically kill, but you do not want to kill
the parent process.

</P>
<P>Any actions performed will be logged to the DAEMON syslog facility by default.
There is support to optionally also send notifications emails to an
administrator on a global or pre-rule basis.

<P>In addition to Perl 5.005_03 or higher, the following Perl modules are
required:

</P>
<PRE>    Proc::ProcessTable
    Config::General
    Getopt::Long
    POSIX
    File::Basename</PRE>

<P>These two additional modules are not required, but will provide enhanced
functionality if present.

</P>
<PRE>    Net::SMTP
    Unix::Syslog</PRE>

<P>The POSIX module is usually supplied with Perl as standard, as is
File::Basename. All these modules can be obtained from CPAN.
Visit http://search.span.org and http://www.cpan.org for further details.
For the lazy people reading this, you can try the following command to
install these modules:

</P>
<PRE>    for m in Config::General Proc::ProcessTable Net::SMTP \
        Unix::Syslog Getopt::Long; do perl -MCPAN -e&quot;install $m&quot;;done</PRE>

<P>Alternatively you can run the install.sh script which comes in the
distribution tarball. It will attempt to install the right modules,
install the script and configuration file, and generate UNIX man page
documentation.

</P>
<P>By default psmon will look for its runtime configuration in /etc/psmon.conf,
although this can be defined as otherwise from the command line. For system
wide installations it is recommended that you install your psmon in to the
default location.

</P><H1><A NAME="CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION

</A></H1>

<P>The default configuration file location is /etc/psmon.conf. A different
configuration file can be declared from the command line. You will find
an example configuration file supplied in the etc/ directory of the
distribution tarball. It is recommended that you use this as a guide to
writing your own configuration file by hand. Alternatively you can use
the <B>psmon-config</B> script which will interactively create a configuration
for you.

</P>
<P>Syntax of the configuration file is based upon that which is used by
Apache. Each process to be monitored is declared with a Process scope
directive like this example which monitors the OpenSSH daemon:

</P>
<PRE>    &lt;Process sshd&gt;
        spawncmd    /sbin/service sshd start
        pidfile     /var/run/sshd.pid
        instances   50
        pctcpu      90
    &lt;/Process&gt;</PRE>

<P>There is a special <I>*</I> process scope which applies to <I>all</I> running
processes. This special scope should be used with extreme care. It does
not support the use of the <I>SpawnCMD</I>, <I>PIDFile</I>, <I>Instances</I> or <I>TTL</I>
directives. A typical example of this scope might be as follows:

</P>
<PRE>    &lt;Process *&gt;
        pctcpu    95
        pctmem    80
    &lt;/Process&gt;</PRE>

<P>Global directives which are not specific to any one process should be placed
outside of any Process scopes.

</P><H2><A NAME="DIRECTIVES">DIRECTIVES

<DD>
Defines the loglevel priority that notifications to syslog will be
marked as. Valid options are as follows; LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT,
LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO and LOG_DEBUG. The log level
used by a notification for any failed action will automatically be
raised to the next level in order to highlight the failure. May be also be used
in a Process scope which will take priority over a global declaration. This
functionality requires the Unix::Syslog module. Defaults to LOG_NOTICE.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="NeverKillPID">NeverKillPID

functionality requires the Net::SMTP module. Defaults to 20 seconds.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="SpawnLogLevel">SpawnLogLevel

</A></DT>
<DD>
The same as the loglevel directive, but only applies to process spawn actions.
Takes priority over the loglevel directive. May be also be used in a
Process scope which will take priority over a global declaration.
Undefined by default.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="ProtectSafePIDsQuietly">ProtectSafePIDsQuietly

<PRE>    &lt;Process syslogd&gt;
        spawncmd       /sbin/service syslogd restart
        pidfile        /var/run/syslogd.pid
        instances      1
        pctcpu         70
        pctmem         30
    &lt;/Process&gt;</PRE>

<P>Syslog is a good example of a process which can get a little full
of itself under certain circumstances, and excessively hog CPU and
memory. Here we will kill off syslogd processes if it exceeds 70%
CPU or 30% memory utilization.

</P>
<P>Older running copies of syslogd will be killed if they are running,
while leaving the most recently spawned copy which will be listed in
the PID file defined.

</P>
<PRE>    &lt;Process httpd&gt;
        spawncmd      /sbin/service httpd restart
        pidfile       /var/run/httpd.pid
        loglevel      LOG_CRIT
        adminemail    pager@noc.company.com
    &lt;/Process&gt;</PRE>

<P>Here we are monitoring Apache to ensure that it is restarted if
it dies. The pidfile directive in this example is actually
redundant because we have not defined any rule where we should
consider killing any httpd processes.

</P>
<P>All notifications relating to this process will be logged with the
syslog priority of critical (LOG_CRIT), and all emailed to
pager@noc.company.com which could typically forward to a pager.

</P>
<P>Any failed attempts to kill or restart a process will automatically
be logged as a syslog priority one level higher than that specified.
If a restart of Apache were to fail in this example, a wall
notification would be broadcast to all interactive terminals
connected to the machine, since the next log priority up from
LOG_CRIT is LOG_EMERG.

</P>
<P>Note that the functionality to log information to syslog requires
the Unix::Syslog module. In the event that Unix::Syslog is not
installed, PSMon will write all status messages that would have
been destined for syslog, to STDERR instead.

<P>psmon is not especially fast. Much of its time is spent reading the process table.
If the process table is particularly large this can take a number of seconds.
Although is rarely a major problem on todays speedy machines, I have run a few tests
so you take look at the times and decide if you can afford the wait.

<P>The __DATA__ section of the PSMon code contains a stub version of the
Unix::Syslog module. It is automatically loaded in the event that the
real Unix::Syslog module is not present and/or cannot be loaded. This stub
module provides very basic functionality to output the messages generated
by the PSMon::Logging module to STDERR, instead of simply dropping them.

<P>Hopefully none. ;-) Send any bug reports to me at nicolaw@cpan.org
along with any patches and details of how to replicate the problem.
Please only send reports for bugs which can be replicated in the
<I>latest</I> version of the software. The latest version can always be
found at http://search.cpan.org/~nicolaw/

</A></H1>

<P>The following functionality will be added soon:

</P><DL><DT><A NAME="Code%20cleanup">Code cleanup

</A></DT>
<DD>
The code needs to be cleaned up and made more efficient. The bulk of the
code will be moved to a separate module, and psmon as you know it now will
become a much smaller and simpler wrapper script.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="Apply%20contributed%20patches">Apply contributed patches

</A></DT>
<DD>
Users of psmon have sent me various patches for additional functionality.
These will be incorporated in to the next major release of psmon once the
code has been properly abstracted.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="killperprocessname%20directive">killperprocessname directive

</A></DT>
<DD>
Will accept a boolean value. If true, only 1 process per process scope
will ever be killed, instead of all process IDs matching kill rules.
This should be used in conjunction with the new killcmd directive. For
example, you may define that a database daemon may never take up more
than 90% CPU time, and it runs many children processes. If it exceeds
90% CPU time, you want to issue ONE restart command in order to stop and
then start all the database processes in one go.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="time%20period%20limited%20rules">time period limited rules

</A></DT>
<DD>
Functionality to limit validity of process scopes to only be checked
between defined time periods. For example, only check that httpd is running
between the hours of 8am and 5pm on Mondays and Tuesdays.
