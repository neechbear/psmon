                       PSMON - Process Monitoring Daemon

   psmon is a Perl script which can be run as a stand alone program or a
   fully functional background daemon, capable of logging to syslog with
   customisable email notification facilities.

   The user defines a set of rules in an Apache-style plain text
   configuration file. These rules describe what processes should always be
   running on the system, and any limitations on concurrent instances, TTL
   and maximum CPU/memory usage of processes. psmon scans the UNIX process
   table and, using the set of rules defined in the configuration file, will
   respawn any dead processes, and/or slay or "deal with" any aggressive or
   illegal processes.

   Originally written and designed for use by a UK ISP, it is designed to be
   as flexible as posible, for use on a per-user, or system-wide server
   basis.

   For further detailed information on what psmon can do for you, how
   flexible it is and a list of all its features, please read the
   documentation. Please feel free to email me at nicolaworthington@msn.com
   with any questions, suggestions or bug reports you may have.

Platforms

   psmon is known to work fine on the following Linux distributions:

     * Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0
     * Mandrake Linux 8.1, 9.0, 9.1 beta
     * Debian Woody, Potato, Sid
     * SuSE Linux 7.2, 7.3
     * Caldera OpenLinux 2.4

   Please let me know if you have tested it on any other platforms. Since it
   is written in Perl, using commonly available CPAN modules, it should be
   portable to most *NIX platforms without modification. Unfortunately I have
   not had the oppertunity to put this to the test, (yet).

           Work is beginning on allowing regex style process scopes to match
           against cmndline information. Development versions are available
           from CVS. Not for use in live production environments.

   2003/Mar/25
           There is a typo in the main loop of release 1.0.3, of $O{pidfile}
           being referenced instead of $pidfile. This causes the --daemon
           functionality to fail. It snuk in when the pidfile variable was
           moved out of the globals in to a lexically scoped variable. It is
           fixed in the current devleopment CVS revision and will be fixed in
           the next tagged release.

   2003/Mar/19
           If you use the --user function of psmon, you must upgrade to
           version 1.0.2 or better. Earlier versions have a gaping bug
           whereby the either all or no processes in the process table are
           identified as being owned by the specified user.

Requirements

   psmon is written in Perl, and has been confirmed to work with Perl
   versions 5.005_03, 5.60, 5.61 and 5.80. The following CPAN modules are
   also required:

     * POSIX (part of the standard Perl distribution)
     * Getopt::Long (part of the standard Perl distribution)
     * Net::SMTP (download)
     * Proc::ProcessTable (download)
     * Config::General (download)
     * Unix::Syslog (download)

   These Perl modules are included in the psmon tarball. The install.sh
   installation script will attempt to install any of these modules if are
   not already installed, with the exception of POSIX, Getopt::Long, and
   Net::SMTP. (The first two will always be present, and the latter can be
   installed manually from the libnet tar.gz file provided). See the CPAN FAQ
   at http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html and psmon documentation for
   further information.
